    deaccessions_tooltip: |
      <p>The Bentley Historical Library uses the term "deaccessions" to refer to unprocessed accessioned materials that are formally deselected from processing all together</p>
      <p>Bentley generally uses the term "separations" for materials that are not included in the final collection, or weeded during processing. </p>
