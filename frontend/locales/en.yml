The title element is not necessary if you are describing a subordinate archival object that has inherited the description of a parent object and only needs to be distinguished by a date range. In these cases, skip creation of a title and only create a date record.</p>
      <p>See the section in the processing manual on creating <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/processing/processing-workflow/description/archival-description/common-archival-elements#h.ukwdvqgbry65">titles</a> for additional information.</p>

    era_tooltip: |
      <p>NOT USED</p>
    calendar_tooltip: |
      <p>NOT USED</p>

  extent: &extent_attributes
    portion_tooltip: |
      <p>This element indicates if a given extent record represents the entirety of the material being described or only a portion.</p>
      <p>Ex.: A resource record with two extent records (e.g., "10 linear feet" and "5 volumes") will have portions of "Part" and an archival object with a single extent record (e.g., "3 folders") will have a portion of "Whole".</p>
    extent_type_tooltip: &extent_type_tooltip |
      <p>This field will be used to record the type of unit for an extent statement. Remember, if there is more than one type, multiple extent records must be used.</p>
    container_summary_tooltip: |
      <p>This field will only be used to record additional information about an extent statement--for example, in situations where a difference in linear extent and number of boxes requires clarification (e.g., 2.5 Linear Feet of records "in 3 boxes").</p>
    physical_details_tooltip: |
      <p>The "Physical Details" field will be used to record information and special physical characteristics of content (including information necessary to access or use materials). This field could be used to specify the specific format of items (e.g., "VHS Cassettes" or "Architectural Drawings").</p>
    dimensions_tooltip: |
      <p>The "Dimensions" field can be used to document information about the size of the materials being described for a given extent. Usually includes numerical data; measurements may be expressed in any convenient unit (e.g., "8 x 10 inches").</p>

      <<: *user_defined_attributes
    id_0_tooltip: |
      <p>REQUIRED FIELD. Portions of the identifier will be generated automatically by the application.</p>
    title_tooltip: |
      <p>REQUIRED FIELD. The resource title should be brief and uniquely identify the material, noting both the individual/entity primarily responsible for the creation or 
      accumulation of the materials as well as the predominant unit of archival materials found in the collection (e.g. "papers", "records", "collection").</p>
    level_tooltip: |
      <p>REQUIRED FIELD. Indicates the hierachical level of the materials being described.</p>

    repository_processing_note_tooltip: |
      <p>Do not use this field.</p>
    extents_tooltip: |
      <p>The extent element helps researchers understand the overall amount of content in a collection and also yields information that is important for the Bentley's collection management practices.</p>
      <p>As with dates, ArchiveSpace permits the documentation of very granular information about extents, including the type of extent measurement (e.g., "linear feet" or "oversize folders") and summary information about the containers.</p>
      <p>Refer to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/processing/processing-workflow/description/archival-description/common-archival-elements#h.9diuqwjgb6wz">processing manual</a> for additional information.</p>

    instances_tooltip: |
      <p>Do not associate instances with top-level resource records.</p>

    linked_agents_tooltip: |
        <p>DO NOT create new agents. Determine if you are creating a person, family, or corporate body and search for the relevant agent. If you would like to create an agent that is not in the repository, consult with the Lead Archivist for Collections Management.</p>
        <p>Only associate linked agents with Resource records, not Archival Objects.</p>
    subjects_tooltip: |
        <p>DO NOT create new subjects. Please search for appropriate subjects to describe the collection. If you would like use a subject heading that is not in the repository, consult with the Lead Archivist for Collections Management.</p>

    deaccessions_tooltip: |
      <p>The Bentley Historical Library uses the term "deaccessions" to refer to unprocessed accessioned materials that are formally deselected from processing all together.</p>
      <p>Bentley generally uses the term "separations" for materials that are not included in the final collection, or weeded during processing.</p>
      <p>Record both "deacessions" and "separations" in an ArchivesSpace deaccession record.</p>
      <p>Refer to the Bentley's <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/accessions/archivesspace-accessions">accessioning guidelines</a> for more information.</p>
    collection_management_tooltip: |
      <p>The accessioning archivist will fill out the following two fields of the Collection Management section: processing priority and processing status. The remaining sections will be filled out by the Lead Archivist for Collections Management.</p>
      <p>Refer to the Bentley's <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/accessions/archivesspace-accessions">accessioning guidelines</a> for more information.</p>
    dates_tooltip: |
      <p>Do not add Dates to accessions. More precise inclusive and bulk dates will be added to ArchivesSpace resources during processing. If you know an approximate date range for the materials in a given accession, indicate that in the content description text box.</p>
    extents_tooltip: |
      <p>Indicates the extent and the physical nature of the materials being described.</p>
      <p>Refer to the Bentley's <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/accessions/archivesspace-accessions">accessioning guidelines</a> for more information.</p>

  collection_management: &collection_management_attributes
    processing_priority_tooltip: |
      <p>Select the appropriate processing priority (High, Medium, Low) from the dropdown menu. The processing priority is determined by the field archivist responsible for the acquisition.</p>
    processing_status_tooltip: |
      <p>The accessioning archivist should select the processing status for the collection when material is initially received. In most cases this will be “backlog.” When the collection is assigned to a processor, the Lead Archivist for Collection Management, will update this field to indicate that the material is “in progress” and “complete” once the finding aid (and all other descriptive tools) is posted online.</p>
