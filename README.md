# BHL ASpace Translations
This ArchivesSpace plugin adds customized English-language translations for tooltips and user defined fields at the Bentley Historical Library.

## Directory Structure
    frontend\
        locales\
            en.yml


## How it Works
The file at `frontend/locales/en.yml` overrides the default ArchivesSpace English-language translations in the ArchivesSpace staff interface. The default English-language translations can be found in the application's source code at `common/locales/en.yml`. This plugin overrides many of the application's default tooltips to include information specific to the use of various fields at the Bentley Historical Library in addition to overriding several labels for user defined fields to reflect their use at the BHL.
